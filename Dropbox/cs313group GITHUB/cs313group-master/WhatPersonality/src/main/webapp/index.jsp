                    <p>Dealing with other people can be challenging. With different cultural backgrounds, norms, and traditions, it can be like walking through a landmine at times. Wouldn't you want to make it as easy as you can?</p>
                    <p>One way to "simplify this communication process is by understanding how you communicate, and how others communicate. Your personality type can give you insight into how you communicate.</p>
                    <p>There are more complex personality assessments, but a simple one is the DISC personality types. This application is designed to suggest your dominant personality type.</p>
